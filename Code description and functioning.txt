Randomized N-Queens Solver
This approach solves the N-Queens problem using a randomized strategy. It generates multiple N × N matrices, attempts to place queens randomly while maintaining validity, and evaluates success rates and execution time.

Methodology:
Matrix Initialization – Create an N × N matrix initialized with zeros.
Randomized Placement – Generate random positions for queens, ensuring no conflicts (row, column, diagonal).
Conflict Analysis – Identify and mark forbidden cells before placing each queen.
Validation & Iteration – Verify if the generated board is a valid solution and repeat for 10 random matrices.
Performance Metrics – Measure execution time, count successful vs. unsuccessful solutions.

Output:
Board visualization with placed queens.
Coordinates of placed queens.
Success or failure of each attempt.
Execution time and success rate.
